<p>This week I met up with an old friend who I haven't seen in something like 8 years! We were best friends when we were younger, but unlike a lot of friends who you kinda know at school just "because" and drift apart when you're older, we've always had a pretty good connection, and it was great to find out this week that it was still there. :D</p>

<p>We had such a fun day recounting silly memories of schoolgirl crushes, or wandering around with our walkman together listening to Backstreet Boys and Radiohead. Apart from both being pretty similar in terms of being creative and into the same music, one of the biggest things we share is our love for videogames!</p>

<p>And the videogame that pretty much defines our childhood and friendship is without a doubt, <strong>Toejam and Earl</strong>, which inspired this drawing :) We used to play on the Sega Megadrive a lot together and the wonderful thing about Toejam and Earl was the hilarious co-op mode you could play on both games. The funny comments and quips they would say to each other, and the way you could face each other, crouch and high-five to share your health equally. Despite the fact that the first Toejam and Earl game came out 21 years ago, I still think today that they had one of the best friendships portrayed in a videogame, throughout both games (I'm pretending the third didn't exist *cough*). They shared funny and even touching moments - such as when they both have love interests in the second game - and they always supported each other :)</p>

<p>I always played as Earl (the sorta lazy, sleepy, clumsy one XD) and she Toejam (the sensible one telling him to get a move on!) and we still use the nicknames TJ and Big Earl for each other now XD It makes me really happy that an awesome videogame and an awesome friendship are equally timeless :)</p>

</a>
</figure>

<p>It's Winter, and it's getting colder, which inspired me to make this drawing featuring the Pandalion. I think Winter is my favourite season! :D To expand on the points drawn above:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<strong>Snuggly layers!</strong> <br>Whilst Summer can get unbearably hot and it's hard to cool down, I think it's *always* pretty easy to warm up in Winter.. even if that means drowning yourself in extra shirts, jumpers, scarves, gloves, etc.. Winter clothes are so cosy! I also have the fluffiest ever slipper sock/boot things my mum bought me this year and they are so amazingly comfortable :D And it's an excuse to buy even more cute scarves and socks ^_^
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<strong>More darkness!</strong><br> This may seem an odd thing, as I know lots of people hate the dark mornings, but really, since I've stopped driving a car and started getting a train everywhere, they don't bother me that much! Also perhaps not having such a bad commute these days :) Anyway, the main reason I like the extra darkness is, I have this weird sensitivity to light and get migraines and stuff pretty easily, bright sun tends to make me feel kinda ill :/ The other reason is - my job (web development) and my main hobby (videogames) require screens and screens are so hard to see when it's sunny! XD So yes.. I may be weird but.. I like darkness, I feel more settled and productive!</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<strong>Guilt-free gaming!</strong><br>
I love to play videogames all year round, but in the Summer when most people are outside, I feel kinda like I should probably be outside too! In Winter however, there's none of that feeling, as the weather outside makes me feel like being inside with my DS is clearly the warmest and most sensible place to be :D
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure I could think of even more reasons I love Winter, such as more videogames being released in time for Christmas, and Christmas itself! (yum, turkey). So anyway, I'm feeling pretty happy that it's Wintertime, and I hope you are also enjoying this season too :D</p>

<p>I finally got my tablet and preferred art software up and running since getting a new laptop at home, and now I was in the mood to draw I found myself at a blank at what to draw. @mjtamlyn suggested Zelda and I usually shy away from drawing non-animals, but I thought it would be good to challenge myself. I’ve always wanted to do more non-animally fanart for games, so why not start? :)</p>

<p>Then I had to (of course) go and make it a bit soppy, with the Link thought bubble and heart pieces :)</p>

<p>Overall I like how it turned out and I think I do need to challenge myself more. Also it’s probably the most productive I’ve been drawing-wise in a few months so.. yay.</p>

            <h1><a href="http://thepandalion.com/posts/diablo-iii-whats-all-the-fuss-about.html">Diablo III - what's all the fuss about?</a></h1>

</figure>

<p>It's sorta that time again (<a href="http://thepandalion.com/posts/the-week-i-fell-in-love-with-skyrim.html" target="_blank">November 11th</a> being the last) where I get a little slack on doing web stuff in my spare time and turn my attention to videogames, or one videogame anyway. ;)</p>

<p>This time it's <strong>Diablo III</strong> that is going to be eating my free time for a while. When a new game, and especially a sequel like this comes out, there's a lot of talk about it and people tend to fall into one of these groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Wtf is Diablo III?</strong> people. These people are basically wondering what all the fuss is about and why other people are going on about it.</li>
<li>The <strong>Yay, finally another Diablo game!</strong> people. (e.g - me ;)</li>
<li>And the <strong>Omg Diablo III is different to Diablo II, therefore it sucks!</strong> people, who may have been "Yay finally another Diablo game!" people, but are happier to complain about what they don't like about the game :P I'm not really going to talk about game differences in this post - there are differences, but familiar things too, and imo it's still classic Diablo :)</li>
</ul>

<p>For those in group one - the games in the Diablo series are fantasy action role-playing games, also sometimes described as dungeon-crawling games. The main premise of the games, put simply, is that some terrible fate has fallen over the world, generally meaning lots of monsters are around, including a handful of exceptionally evil ones, and you are the lone hero (unless you choose to play multi-player ;) who has the task of ridding the world of that evil. (How does that not sound totally epic? :D)</p>

<p>One reason people have been so excited about the release of Diablo III is that Diablo II came out a whole <em>eleven years</em> ago, and well, the videogame world has been missing a game like this. There have been RPGs in the meantime of course, but nothing really quite like Diablo (except <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchlight" target="_blank">Torchlight</a> which was heavily inspired by the formula).</p>

<p>I love the formula of action RPGs but especially Diablo, which I think sets itself apart. These are some of the reasons I personally think there are for making a fuss about Diablo III :)</p>
<h3>Playing the epic hero</h3>
<figure>
<img src="./the pandalion's den - ramblings on web design & videogames, doodles, and general geekery_files/7227122992_2ee4b78ebc_o.png" alt="Demon Hunter">
<figcaption>My character - Dainn the Demon Hunter</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As I said, from the moment you begin the game, you are the hero. You can choose your class depending on the sort of play style you like, in DIII that includes things like the Demon Hunter, Barbarian, Monk and of course Wizard. I love games where you get to play a completely epic hero or heroine. I suppose that's what I like about RPGs in general, you can be sort of like yourself except much more bad-ass and powerful. ;) I love playing that role in a game where everybody else needs your help and you are the one who has come to save everyone, and I think Diablo games do a great job of making your character feel super important. Diablo III seems to have introduced a bit more in the way of back stories for the class you pick, but I also like just using my imagination for my character's personality and motivations.</p>

<h3>Causing tons of death and destruction</h3>
<p>(To bad guys of course!) This is also very much related to the sheer amount of monsters you get in this kind of game, especially in dungeons. Most locations in the game are crawling with monsters. It's immensely satisfying (to me anyway) to be a lone hero facing swarms of monsters, and being able to defeat them with your skills and awesomeness despite their number. Wiping out huge numbers of enemies is just.. very fun. xD I know that some people find this repetitive about Diablo games, having to fight tons of hordes of monsters but to me.. it really shows how much evil is around and how much there is to wipe out, and yes, it's inconvenient but that's sorta the whole point ;)</p>

<h3>The LOOT!</h3>
<p>Loot is one of the key things about Diablo's formula and one of the main reasons the game is loved so much. Your character starts off with very basic equipment, maybe a simple weapon they picked up, but along the way, monsters drop tons and tons of items which can help equip your character better for future battles. These could be weapons or armour ranging from chest gear to belts to gloves and boots. Diablo has a system where lots of random items get dropped by monsters so you always have the chance of getting better stuff for your hero. As well as common items they might drop magic, or even rare and legendary items. It's always exciting checking out the new items you've collected or getting a new magic item that boosts your character even more. And because it's random you never know what you might get, which makes the games very replayable I think.</p>

<h3>Fun skills and abilities</h3>
<p>As you level up you will get new skills to use, which you can generally choose and combine, having different skills on mouse buttons and keys. I think this stops Diablo from being a purely hack and slash game, as you can combine abilities for some very cool effects. One of my favourite things about the Demon Hunter class in DIII so far is having trap skills, so I can lure a horde of enemies towards me, trap them and then fire arrows at them before they know what's happened ;)</p>

<h3>The atmosphere/setting</h3> 
<p>Sure, a lot of people play Diablo to build a powerful character, but beyond the gameplay, I love the whole atmosphere, setting and feel to the Diablo games. It's a very dark fantasy setting, and has a range of locations such as towns and outside locales as well as various dungeons and chambers. These always look visually impressive, I think even back in Diablo II eleven years ago the setting always felt very awesome. The various monsters that inhabit the world and the lore around them is always interesting too. For me one thing that stops the game getting boring is discovering a new location, new dungeon, and weird, wonderful, or even grotesque enemies within the Diablo world. (I'm not looking forward to the giant spiders though, they give me nightmares ;).</p>

<p>I think for these reasons, and particularly for the people who grew up playing the previous games in the series, Diablo is pretty much a classic videogame and a unique experience. You can play Diablo co-operatively, and I have good memories of adventuring with friends late into the night, immersed in the world and its demons. I enjoy playing single player, but co-op mode adds another layer of fun and playability to the game. Obviously for people who don't really like the sound of the formula I've talked about above - you may not like the game, but for me epic adventure RPGs don't get much better than this.</p>

<p>And on that note, I'm off to play some more.. ;)</p>

            <h2>April 17, 2012, 11:11 p.m. in <a href="http://thepandalion.com/category/web-design">Web Design</a></h2>
        </header>

        <p>It was sometime in late 2006 that I pulled up in my bright orange Volkswagen beetle, probably wearing blue hair extensions and stripy socks, and first stepped into the converted barn that was the then-office of <a href="http://www.glassesdirect.co.uk/">Glasses Direct</a>.</p>

<p>The following five years were an amazing experience for me, both professionally and personally, as I designed and developed things from emails, page layouts and flash banners to product catalogues, branding and leaflets in the shape of glasses (ok that was just once). I even got to attend a model photoshoot, wow it was tiring not sitting at a desk all day.. ;) From web design to print design to interface design and front end development, there were always problems to be solved and great people to work with and I had so much fun doing that.</p>

<p>I remember so many of our GD social gatherings, from our beginnings in Wiltshire (chips in the village pub, rainy barbecues in the garden), to relocating to London and discovering Thai food for the first time! Some of the people I worked with at Glasses Direct truly became like family to me. They took me on my first ever aeroplane trip, I saw Prague and Spain for the first time with them, I went to maybe my first music gig and nearly fainted XD.</p>

<p>In the past year they welcomed me into the Technology team with open arms, I discovered Git, Python, Django, and the command line, and I worked with wonderful people who always respected me and helped me out immensely. People have blogged about sexism in the tech industry but I have to say that being the only girl in our technology team was never an issue that even *existed* for me at Glasses Direct, and I couldn't have asked for better peers and friends.</p>

<p>It's been awesome seeing and being a part of the growth of <strong>Glasses Direct</strong>, and I'm really proud of where they are now. Five years later, and no longer with blue hair extensions (or sadly, a VW beetle), but with more experience, confidence, and good memories, it's time for me to say a fond farewell. Though I will miss them immensely I'm confident they will do even more awesome things in the future. It's been great being a part of that vision (insert eye pun here, chortle chortle).</p>

<h3>Hello Incuna!</h3>

<a href="http://www.incuna.com/"><img src="./the pandalion's den - ramblings on web design & videogames, doodles, and general geekery_files/7088728615_e1d6a94c31_o.png" alt="Incuna"></a>
</figure>

<p>Whilst the London life was a fun experience for a pandalion (and I did rather like the choice of food there), I am looking forward to finding more bamboo (or perhaps some more patches of green) in Summertown, Oxford, as I join the super awesome <a href="http://www.incuna.com/">Incuna</a> as a Front End Developer!</p>

<p><strong>Incuna</strong> are a digital agency specialising in healthcare, who make super awesome and useful web applications. I love working on stuff that really makes a difference to users and provides them with great solutions, so I'm very excited about joining Incuna! Whilst I enjoyed a mixed UI design/front end development role at Glasses Direct, I am looking forward to focusing my skills on development at Incuna and doing even more awesome things with HTML, CSS and Javascript than ever before!</p>

<p><strong>Incuna</strong> are also just pretty much an awesomely cool company - they use <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, they regularly attend <a href="http://oxford.geeknights.net/2012/may-17th/">Oxford Geek nights</a>, and they even hold their own <a href="http://refreshoxford.co.uk/">hack days</a>!</p>

<p>I am super looking forward to joining them, making new friends and having new adventures, and bringing a little bit of pandaryness to Oxford ;)</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">(I also hear there are some rather <a href="http://www.missionburrito.co.uk/">good burritos</a> in Oxford, and posh fish finger sandwiches, so food wise, I should be fine! :D)</p>
